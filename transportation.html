Yes, they occasionally drive in the wrong direction, cross pedestrian streets, and sit with four or more people! people riding a single motorcycle or transporting numerous items. In Vietnam, nothing is crazy at all!</p>
	<p>Many roads and trail tracks were destroyed between 1955 and 1975 during the Vietnam War. Even though it took place decades ago, you can sometimes still see this.
