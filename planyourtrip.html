  <h2>Knowing About Money and Currency in Vietnam</h2>
  <p>The VND, or Vietnamese dong, symbol: Vietnam's official currency is (). In Vietnam, there appear to be numerous denominations, with the following being the most widely used: 1,000, 2,000, and 5,000 VND; 50,000, 20,000, and 10,000 VND; VND 200,000, VND 50,000, and VND 100,000, respectively. Only paper notes with values of VND 1,000, VND 2,000, and VND 5,000 are still valid in Vietnam since the introduction of polymer money in 2003.</p>
	<p>Most installments are made with Vietnamese Dong, however US dollars can be straightforwardly utilized for certain inns, cafés, visits, or different administrations. In the airport of Ho Chi Minh City, you might notice that the prices of food, beverages, and souvenirs are all listed in US dollars. However, paying with US dollars is not recommended because they will be converted at a lower exchange rate and result in higher costs.</p>

<h2>Where to Change Money in Vietnam?</h2>
		<p><strong style="color: yellow;">Banks:</strong> Around the city, you can change checks and foreign currency at the safest places, like banks like Eximbank, Vietcombank, Vietinbank, and Agribank. However, it takes a long time, and you will be charged a commission rate of 0.5 percent to 2 percent. Additionally, you will be charged an additional 2% of the note's value if your notes are damaged or dirty.</p>
		<p><strong style="color: yellow;">Hotel:</strong> By changing your currency in big hotels, which are nearly as big as banks, you can get a better rate. Additionally, small hotels might charge a service fee.</p>
  <p><strong style="color: yellow;">Airports:</strong> When you arrive at the airports in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, you will find a few places to exchange currencies. However, the exchange rate is not favorable in this location. Therefore, it is best to change a small amount to cover the cost of your taxi ride and travel to the town in search of a better rate.</p>
		<p><strong style="color: yellow;">Gold and Jewelry shops:</strong> You can go to the gold and jewelry stores, usually in red and gold colors, on every main street for better deals. With no fees, the exchange rate is considerably better than that in hotels, banks and airports.</p>
  <p><strong style="color: yellow;">Notice:</strong> You can check the rate and use currency converter (<a href="https://g.co/finance/VND-USD" style="color: lightblue;"> tools online</a>).</p>
