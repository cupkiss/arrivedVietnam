<h2>The North Of Vietnam</h2>
	<p>Hanoi is a city that is both stuck in time and moving forward at the same time. It is on the Red River's banks. You'll be spellbound by Hanoi's atmospheric Old Quarter, stunning Hoan Kiem Lake, and traditional colonial architecture. When you get hungry, you'll find that the northern streetfood is plentiful and delicious, and there are some excellent museums and art galleries to visit. Watch life unfold before you at one of the many charming cafes to get a sense of the city's timeless rhythm.</p>
	<p>Ninh Binh is a picture-perfect landscape that can be found not too far from Hanoi. Here, rowboats will take you on a mesmerizing journey through river caves and sheer limestone cliffs rise straight up from paddy fields. A cruise on Halong Bay, with its thousands of islets and deep, emerald-green waters, is a must for any trip to the north.</p>

	<h2>Top Three Destinations</h2>
	
	<h4>Ha Long Bay</h4>
	<p>For many, Ha Long Bay's seascape is synonymous with Vietnam. The emerald-green waters of the cruise travel between thousands of rugged islands and islets, stopping at stunning caves where visitors can wander and marvel at impressive, centuries-old structures. The mysterious beauty of Ha Long Bay has made it a must-see destination in the country, but you can still find secluded spots to call your own. (Click the image below to see 360 degree tour.)</p>
  <p><strong style="color: antiquewhite">Things to do:</strong>Cruise the bay, explore a floating village (UNESCO-listed site), paddle out the kayak, clamber into a cave, try your hand at rock climbing.</p>

  <h4>Sapa</h4>
	<p>The town of Sapa is at the head of a deep valley with stunning rice terraces that are still being farmed as they have been for centuries. The backdrops don't get much better than this. Whitewater rivers roar through rice fields, enticing ribbons of road descend to the valley floor, and lush green mountains extend as far as the eye can see. The ragged ridge line high above the town is crowned by Mount Fansipan, the region's highest peak.</p>
<p><strong style="color: antiquewhite">Things to do:</strong>Summit Mount Fansipan, visit an ethic minority market, go treckking in the hills, stay in a mountain lodge, mountain biking.</p>

<h4>Ninh Binh</h4>
	<p>Ninh Binh, a mesmerizing region known as "Ha Long Bay on Land" due to its magical riverine landscape of sheer limestone mountains rising from the paddies, is visited by far too few tourists. Taking a paddleboat tour of its glistening rivers and scaling its fabled peaks is the best way to experience this UNESCO-protected site. (Click the image below to see 360 degree tour.)</p>
	<p><strong style="color: antiquewhite">Things to do:</strong>See the view from Hang Mua, take a sampan tour, visit the ancient capital, go in search of the wildlife, visit the Bai Dinh temple.</p>
