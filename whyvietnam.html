  <h2>Breathtaking landscape</h2>
  <p>You will be pleasantly surprised by the breathtaking beauty of some of Vietnam's most well-known World Heritage Sites, such as Ha Long Bay, Phong Nha Ke Bang National Park, and Hoi An Ancient Town... Ha Long Bay's 1500 islands and islets form a stunning seascape of limestone pillars. If you're a nature lover or a photographer, you'll get a lot of good pictures of different things.As one of the largest remaining areas of forest habitat in Vietnam, Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park is of high conservation value. One of the largest areas of forest on limestone karst in Indochina, it is part of a continuous forest block with the Him Namno Biodiversity Conservation Area in Laos. The National Park's tall lowland forest, a threatened habitat type in the region, increases the conservation value of the area.
<br>
  You'll be even more amazed by non-heritage sites. Dalat has a lot of French-style villas and is beautiful; Sapa is romantic and misty, like a girl getting ready in the morning; and Vietnam's extensive coastline offers seemingly endless scenic sea views, private and leisurely sunbathing, and a straightforward beach stroll.</p>

<h2>Friendly and hospitable people</h2>
		<p>The majority of clients who travel with Paradise Travel leave feedback about their experiences, emphasizing their profound impression of Vietnamese hospitality and friendliness. Travelers claim that Vietnam holds a priceless treasure: its members. Whether or not you are familiar with the locals, everyone from the North to the South will warmly welcome you. Even if this is your first time visiting their house with a local guide, ethnic minority people in Sapa always treat you like a friend. In contrast, the people of Hoi An are known for being sincere, while those in Hue have an attitude that is more royal than welcoming. Farmers in the Mekong Delta will always warmly and enthusiastically welcome you into their homes.</p>
<br>

	<h2>Traditional festivals</h2>
		<p>Vietnam holds festivals throughout the year because of its long history, rich tradition, and Buddhist influence. Many of these festivals are unheard of in the West and are really fun to learn about. For instance, the Tet holiday is an ideal time to observe how families demonstrate their love for one another and for their ancestors. Tet is not to be confused with Chinese New Year, which could even be considered an insult to some nationalists. Although it has a Vietnamese flavor, it has many similarities to the Lunar New Year. For instance, in the countryside, people stay the night and make Chung cake while exchanging end-of-year gossip and a little bit of fire. The buffalo fighting festival is a well-known event in Hai Phong: The buffalo that comes out on top will be killed and given to the village god. Even Vietnam's public holidays can be enjoyed: When you visit Vietnam on September 2, you will witness nationwide parades. Red flags will illuminate the entire street, and fireworks will fill the night sky. On our events page, you can see what activities you can participate in on your next trip.</p>

<h2>Tasty and exquisite cuisine</h2>
  <p>You might be familiar with Pho noodles, spring rolls, and Bun Cha because they might be available in your country. However, Vietnamese cuisine goes beyond that and is regionally specific, featuring a variety of fresh meat, poultry, seafood, and vegetables. While high-end customers frequently dine in luxury colonial restaurants, culinary adventurers enjoy trying new foods on the street. Dinners in the caves, and sampling delectable menus at candlelit tables, inspire honeymooners. Due to the excellent and memorable seafood served onboard the traditional junk, many tourists have decided to return to Ha Long Bay. So, why don't you go to Vietnam this time to not only see, do, and touch it, but also to smell, taste it, and remember everything you see and do there?</p>

<h2>Memorable travel experience</h2>
  <p>Your preferences must dictate a one-of-a-kind travel experience. Do you want to have an experience that isn't common? Do you wish to emulate locals? Trek to ethnic minority villages near Sapa to take pictures of the terraced fields, stay in a homestay, and appreciate the mountain lifestyle and atmosphere. Cruise the Thu Bon River in Hoi An to catch the sunrise or sunset. On Ha Long Bay, paddle your kayak to experience the breathtaking beauty of thousands of islets and islands. The excellent services here, in addition to the scenery and people, will add more pages to your itinerary. 
<br>
		Navigate through the Mekong Delta's floating markets. Some of the most popular floating markets are in the river town of Can Tho, but they can be found anywhere along the Mekong. The floating markets of the Mekong are truly an experience to be witnessed because they are as crowded, bustling, and chaotic as street markets. Relax and let the waves of Da Nang, Nha Trang, or Mui Ne take the edge off of your hectic day. Vietnam has a number of the best beaches in the world. The majority of them are safe to swim in, and there are also opportunities for water sports. Kite-running and windsurfing, for instance, are activities available in Nha Trang. Experience one of Da Nang's world-class beach resorts for a family or romantic getaway. While making preparations for your trip to Mui Ne for a seafood dinner, take in the peace and wildness of the area.</p>

	<h2>Approximate Budget</h2>
	<p>
	Building up a picture of how much it would cost to travel to Vietnam for a month and determining a target spending limit A thirty-day budget of approximately US$ 3,000 (total for two people) was the rough estimate. When people travel for a long time, they realize how much they will enjoy food, particularly the food we are familiar with. Consequently, even in Vietnam, which is relatively inexpensive, travelers will be surprised by how much they spent overall on dining out. On the other hand, you will be able to spend more on activities and stay in better accommodations if you have a healthy budget. Each traveler will have their preferred mode of transportation and will have different tolerance levels for various indulgences. You won't be able to get a great deal on a hotel if you come during peak season when there will be less availability. If you change that to low season, you have a great chance of getting a really good deal on a place to stay.
